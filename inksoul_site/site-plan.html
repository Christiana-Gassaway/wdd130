        Personal Site Goal/Interaction
      </p>
      <p>
        The aim of making a website for Inksoul is to excite any visitors into checking out my online web comic, Inksoul. I want all who visit to leave with a better understanding of what kind of story I am trying to write. The goal is to pique their interest enough that they will go and read Inksoul afterwards using the links provided on the site's home page, and if I'm lucky, I might even be able to cultivate fans through these means. Given that the webtoon currently only has about three episodes up, it's likely that most people who visit the site won't know much about the comic at all. I'll need to do a thorough job in explaining the summary of the story, the genre, the individual characters, and also describe the world itself and the magic system involved so that people can get a broad idea on what makes my comic unique. Given that there aren't any other sources talking about this comic, I will have the sole responsibility of capturing my visitors' attention, so it is imperative that my summaries and descriptions are both clear and concise.

      <h3>Page 2 - "Meet the Characters"</h3>
      <p>
        Audience Interaction/Specific Site Content
      </p>
      <p>
        In regards to “activities”, the aim is to get visitors interested enough in the summary to explore what the main characters are about on my second page. I will be sure to provide images of each of the characters as well as a blurb of their history/personalities. I can add more or less diagrams for visual interest as well, depending on how deeply in-depth I feel I should go. I need to take into account for potential spoilers though, and not give out any information that I intend to reveal later on in the run of my comic. The most necessary pieces of information to include will be the name of the story, the summary, and where it can be read online. (Webtoon) I can include a paragraph with a URL to Inksoul, as well as some general information such as the author's name, update times, the story's status (currently on hiatus), and potentially even links to social media accounts. In addition, I plan to address and describe my characters on a secondary page, so providing their names and roles in the story will be necessary. On a separate third page, I intend to talk about the setting itself, so providing the name of the world and describing the magic system will be equally as important. I can include pictures of the world's continent/topography, and explain which settings are the most focal ones in Inksoul's story.

      <p>General Programming Needs/Draw of the Site</p>
      <p>
        Personally, the information that I will need to make this site happen, is going to be a reminder list of how to use the grid layout in CSS. There are also some special functions that I may want to look into—I have a few unique ideas for how I want to present my Inksoul characters, and it is going to involve learning some new CSS. I have this sort of lazy-Suzan style rotator in my mind, where you can click left and right to switch through the characters and their information. Naturally, the main draw of this personal website, is that it is an official page made by the actual author. I can personally assure my audience that all of the information is up to date and as accurate as possible. Not to mention, since Inksoul is brand-new, there are no other sites talking about it. It will be the only site discussing this niche comic, so anyone that wants to learn more about it will have to visit my page to get the most accurate information.
