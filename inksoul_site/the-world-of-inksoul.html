                    <h1>Inksoul's Landscape: The Continent of Sylva</h1>
                    <p>Inksoul's story takes place in Sylva; a fictional continent located on an alternate version of planet Earth. Sylva is broken into 7 distinct countries, with Amberleaf being the most prominent location down south. Isolated from the rest of the world, Amberleaf is considered the only safe haven for ungifted and cursed individuals. It is considerably more peaceful than the other countries in Sylva, but is surrounded by a vast, dangerous wasteland—making it a difficult place to travel to.
                    <br>The rest of Sylva is divided into the countries: Spearoot, Everwood, Liliáke, Breezy Peaks, Silvine, Cryosia, and Parapelago; all of which are on the brink of a world war, due to the increasing spread of a bioweapon known as the Ruin Disease. (AKA, the Inksouls.) Relations with Amberleaf and the rest of the world have never been particularly stable, so the fact that it's the final country to be targeted makes it the most likely suspect for the origin of this bioweapon. As Amberleaf slowly gets overrun, it will be the job of the protagonists to both fight the disease, and uncover the true villain before war can begin.</p>

                    <h1> The Ancient Seven Mages</h1>
                    <p>Several thousands of years ago, Sylva was a single country ruled by seven individuals known as the Sacred Mages. Though it is unknown how or when the mages came to power, Sylva's history depicts these seven individuals as being responsible for giving magic to humans. They each ruled peacefully over different territories of the land, spreading both their power, lineage, and influence, until over centuries of time, each one of the territories fell into disrepair.
                    <br>The Sacred Mages, now presently referred to as the “Cursed Mages”, became corrupt with greed, and destroyed each other until none of the mages remained. What was left in the wake of their ruling were seven divided countries, and the magic they'd bestowed upon humanity known as: “gifts”. Another detail of note: all seven of the mages had red eyes, which was considered a mark of their incredible power. No one will ever be born with one of the mages' gifts again, however those connected to the mages' bloodline have a chance of inheriting their red eyes. It is now considered a curse if a child is born with red eyes because the legends associate this trait with betrayal and overwhelming power.</p>

                <h1>The Magic System</h1>
                <p>Rather than acting as a nebulous force of nature, magic in Inksoul functions according to a special science. To elaborate, every human in Sylva has something called a magic reservoir inside of their body. It works similar to an organ—it can be damaged if attacked directly, and it can absorb, convert, and expel magic energy similar to the way lungs work. As long as the surrounding air contains magic, a human born with a magical reservoir can absorb that magic, and then expel it in the form of their gift.<br>
                All reservoirs vary in efficiency though. The more trained someone is in using magic, the more efficient and thus more powerful their magical reservoir can be. This is measured using the Magical Regulation Index (MRI) on the far left in the diagram, and the higher percentage someone's MRI is, the more magic they can store and expel in their body at one time. The right diagram represents a gift users power numeral. Each number determines a different strength class. The colors however provide a general assumption of the user's likely amount of physical activity: gray and blue equating the strength of an average citizen, green an athlete, and yellow a trained military officer. The top numeral marked as “V”, stands for “volatile”, and is saved for any gift users whose powers can cause calamitous damage, or frequently go out of control. This numeral is rare though, and so the government keeps a close eye on those marked with it.
