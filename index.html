                <p>Hello, my name is Christiana! I am currently an art student majoring in illustration, but I wanted to try programming because I have an interest in computers too.
                    I am a person of many hobbies. I love to draw, mostly with digital art, and am currently working on my passion project, Inksoul. It is still a work in progress, but I have a couple of comics posted on Webtoon right now.
                    I am the youngest of three brothers in my family, and have been born and raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. My favorite scripture is Romans 1:16, which reads: "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth".
                </p>    
                <p>Lastly, I enjoy plenty of video games and anime, so if anyone is interested in being trounced at Mario Kart, I will be happy to oblige.
                </p>
                <p> Favorite Games: Mario Kart 8, Celeste, Mario Odyssey, Animal Crossing, Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon, Miitopia, Subnautica, etc.
